<h2><font color="#C11B17">Areas of the Field</font></h2>  
<p>
1. &nbsp;&nbsp;The boundary lines are the end lines and sidelines and are out of bounds.
</p>
<p>
2. &nbsp;&nbsp;The end zones are 10 yards in depth and are located at each end of the
field between the goal line and the end line. The goal line is in the end zone. The
end line is the outer limit of each end zone.
</p>
<p>
3. &nbsp;&nbsp;The field is the area within the boundary lines and the end lines.
</p>
<p>
4. &nbsp;&nbsp;The field of play is the area within the boundary lines and the goal lines.
</p>
<p>
5. &nbsp;&nbsp;The goal line is the vertical plane that separates the field of play from
the end zone. When related to a live ball in a runner's possession (touching
inbounds) while the ball is over the out-of-bounds area, the goal line includes the
extension beyond the sidelines. A team's own goal line is the one it is defending.
</p>
<p>
6. &nbsp;&nbsp;The hash marks are a series of hash marks parallel with the sidelines
that divide the field of play longitudinally into thirds. The hash marks shall be
marked so that the-yard lines bisect the hash marks.
</p>
<p>
7. &nbsp;&nbsp;Sidelines are the lateral limit of the field of play and the end zones.
They extend from one end line to the other. Sidelines are out of bounds.
</p>
<p>
8. &nbsp;&nbsp;The side zones are the areas bounded by the sidelines, the hash marks
and the goal lines.
</p>
<p>
9. &nbsp;&nbsp;Yard lines are any lines and their vertical planes parallel to the end
lines. The yard lines, marked or unmarked, in the field of play are numbered in

yards from a team's own goal line to the middle of the field.
