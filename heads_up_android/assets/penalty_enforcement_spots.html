<h2><font color="#C11B17">Penalty Enforcement Spots</font></h2>  
<p>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The basic spot is a point of reference for penalty enforcement. It is the previous spot for a loose-ball play unless the only accepted penalty meets the requirements of a post-scrimmage kick foul and the end of the run for a running play.
</p>
<p>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The enforcement spot is the point from that a penalty is enforced.
</p>
<p>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The post-scrimmage kick spot is the spot where the kick ends. Fouls by R behind the post-scrimmage kick spot are spot fouls.
</p>
<p>
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous spot is where the ball was last snapped or free kicked.
</p>
<p>
5.&nbsp;&nbsp; The spot of a foul is where the foul occurs. If a foul occurs out of bounds, the spot of the foul is at the intersection of the nearer inbounds line and the-yard line extended on that the foul occurs.
</p>
<p>
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;The spot where a run ends is where the runner loses player possession or where the ball becomes dead in his possession.
<p>
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The succeeding spot is where the ball would next be snapped or free kicked if a foul had not occurred.
