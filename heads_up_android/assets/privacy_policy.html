	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>

("USAF", "we", or "us") recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of information provided by users of our web site, www.usafootball.com and our application(s), which include but are not limited to Heads Up Football (web site and applications are collectively referred to as the "Site"). We created this policy ("Policy") with a fundamental respect for our users' right to privacy and to guide our relationships with our users. The Policy discloses the privacy practices for the Site. USAF may modify the Policy at any time and, accordingly, we urge you to frequently review the Policy. USAF will always apply the Policy under which your information was collected, unless we obtain your consent.

    	This Policy was last modified on July 26, 2012.

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
    	USAF collects information from visitors to the Site whether such visitor is a member or non-member of USAF. In this section of the Policy, we describe the type of information we collect and how we use it to provide better services to visitors of the Site. You may be asked to voluntarily provide your name, billing address, shipping address, phone number, credit card number, email address, or other personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") to have access to some features of the Site. By using the Site and providing us with your Personal Information, you consent to USAF's use of such information as described in this Policy. You may always refuse to provide your Personal Information, and this may lead to our inability to provide you with certain services. USAF or our business partners may also collect information that is anonymous, such as your IP number (a number used to identify your computer on the Internet) or the type of browser you are using ("Anonymous Information"), through the use of cookies or by other means. USAF hopes that, by using Anonymous Information, we can update the Site to make it more useful to you and other users. USAF reserves the right to maintain, update, disclose or otherwise use Anonymous Information, without limitation, including use for industry reporting purposes.
    </p>

    	USAF may use your Personal Information for the following purposes: to process your registration or orders; to administer your account; to administer and improve the Site and related services; to notify you of our or third party products, services, promotional events or special offers that maybe of interest to you; to enhance your online experience and content, to make information and opportunities available to you, to provide Internet security; and to meet legal requirements. USAF may work with our business partners who may perform certain functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling orders, sending email messages, managing data, processing credit card payments or providing customer service. These business partners have access to your Personal Information only to the extent necessary to perform these specific functions and may not use it for any other purpose. When USAF offers co-branded, customized or sponsored products and services, or when we join with other parties to provide specific products or services, we may share (provide and receive) Personal Information with them. We do not share credit card information with such third parties. These third parties will use the information according to their own privacy policies, and we urge participants to read those policies before registering. Other than for the specific purposes set forth in this Policy, USAF will not disclose your Personal Information unless we obtain your prior consent or are legally required to do so. USAF may use third party advertising companies to place ads on the Site and to place our ads on other web sites. These companies may use Anonymous Information about your visits to this and other web sites to provide advertisements on the Site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If USAF is involved in the sale of a substantial portion of its business assets, Anonymous or Personal Information may be among the transferred assets.
