        	All players are eligible to receive passes (including the quarterback, if the ball has been handed off behind the line of scrimmage).
        </li>
        <li>
        	Only one player is allowed in motion at a time. All motion must be parallel to the line of scrimmage and no motion is permitted towards the line of scrimmage.
        </li>
        <li>
        	A player must have a least one foot inbounds when making a reception.
        </li>
        <li>
        	In the case of simultaneous possession by both an offensive and defensive player, possession is awarded to the offense.
        </li>
        <li>
        	Interceptions change the possession of the ball at the point of interception. Interceptions are the only changes of possession that do not start on the 5-yard line.

        	Interceptions are returnable but not on conversions after touchdowns.
