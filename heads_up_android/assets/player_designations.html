<h2><font color="#C11B17">Player Designations</font></h2>  
<p>
1. &nbsp;&nbsp;A player is one of the 22 team members on the field or one who
subsequently replaces another player.<br>
- A player continues to be a player until a substitute enters
the field and indicates to the player that he is replaced or
when the substitute otherwise becomes a player.
</p>
<p>
2. &nbsp;&nbsp;A back is any A player who has no part of his body breaking the plane
of an imaginary line drawn parallel to the line of scrimmage through the waist of
the nearest teammate who is legally on the line, except for the player under the
snapper, who is also considered a back.
</p>
<p>
3. &nbsp;&nbsp;A blocker is a player who is blocking or is in position to block.
</p>
<p>
4. &nbsp;&nbsp;A captain of a team is a player designated to represent his team during
the pregame and overtime coin tosses, the selection of second-half options,
penalty decisions following fouls and ball placement on trys, kickoffs, after
safetys, after fair catches or awarded fair catches, after touchbacks and to start
overtimes.
</p>
<p>
5. &nbsp;&nbsp;A disqualified player is a player barred from further participation in a
game.
</p>
<p>
6. &nbsp;&nbsp;A holder is a player who controls the ball on the ground or on a kicking
tee.
</p>
<p>
7. &nbsp;&nbsp;A kicker is any player who legally punts, drop kicks or placekicks. A
player becomes a kicker when his knee, lower leg or foot makes contact with the
ball. He continues to be the kicker until he has had reasonable opportunity to
regain his balance or until after a free kick, he has advanced 5 yards beyond his

free-kick line or the kick has touched the ground or any other player.
</p>
<p>
8. &nbsp;&nbsp;A lineman is any A player who is facing his opponent�s goal line with
the line of his shoulders approximately parallel to the line of scrimmage and with
his head or foot breaking an imaginary plane drawn parallel to the line of
scrimmage through the waist of the snapper when the ball is snapped.
</p>
<p>
9. &nbsp;&nbsp;A nonplayer is a coach, athletic trainer, other attendant, a substitute or
a replaced player who does not participate by touching the ball, hindering an
opponent or influencing the play.
</p>
<p>
10. &nbsp;&nbsp;A player or other person is out of bounds when any part of the person
is touching anything, other than another player or game official, that is on or
outside the sideline or end line.
</p>
<p>
11. &nbsp;&nbsp;A passer is a player who throws a legal forward pass. He continues to
be a passer until the legal forward pass ends or until he moves to participate in
the play.
</p>
<p>
12. &nbsp;&nbsp;A replaced player is one who has been notified by a substitute that he
is to leave the field. A player is also replaced when the entering substitute
becomes a player.
</p>
<p>
13. &nbsp;&nbsp;A runner is a player who is in possession of a live ball or is simulating
possession of a live ball.
</p>
<p>
14. &nbsp;&nbsp;A snapper is the player who is facing his opponent�s goal line with his
shoulders approximately parallel thereto and who snaps the ball. In a scrimmage-
kick formation, the snapper remains a snapper until he has had a reasonable
opportunity to regain his balance and protect himself or until he blocks or moves
to otherwise participate in the play.
</p>
<p>
15. &nbsp;&nbsp;A substitute is a team member who may replace a player or fill a
player vacancy. A substitute becomes a player when he enters the field and
communicates with a teammate or an official, enters the huddle, is positioned in
a formation or participates in the play. An entering substitute is not considered to
be a player for encroachment restrictions until he is on his team�s side of the
neutral zone. A team member entering the field to fill a player vacancy remains a
substitute until he is on his team�s side of the neutral zone.
</p><p>
In USA Football, it is not a foul for the offense to have more than 11 players in
the huddle or to break the huddle with more than 11 players. A foul occurs if a
replaced player does not leave the field upon being notified by a teammate he is
to leave the field. That may or may not occur as the huddle is breaking.
